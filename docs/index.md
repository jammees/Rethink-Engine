      <h1>2D games</h1>
      <p>Ever thought about making a 2D game with UI elements? But stepped back, because <b>ROBLOX</b> does not provide any tools to do so?
      Well, Rethink might be the engine for you!</p>
      <p>Rethink comes with a plugin and a wild variety of tools ready-to-use for developers!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h1>Framework support</h1>
      <p>Would you like to use Rethink, but you don't have that functionality that you like in a framework you use?</p>
      <p>Do not worry, because Rethink does not limit where and how you can use the tools, it is possible to pair Rethink with frameworks of your choice!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h1>Open source</h1>
      <p>Rethink will always be open sourced and free-to-use!</p>
      <p>Contributions to the engine are always welcome! In case of bug(s) found in the engine or would like to request a new feature, please create an issue with the right template!</p>
